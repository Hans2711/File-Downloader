# File Downloader
 Downloads files from a ftp server with encrypted request
 
 Put the PHP Folder on ur FTP server
 and use the code in c++ Folder to download the files
 replace the url part in the c++ code to ur own url which directs to the folder on ur FTP server with the php code in it.
 
 
 i know the encryption is very weak just replace it with some real aes encryption or so im just lazy
